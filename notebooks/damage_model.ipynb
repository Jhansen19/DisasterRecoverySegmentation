Pay special attention to `COST_FACTORS_PER_SQ_M` (adjust your rough estimates), `GSD_METERS_PER_PIXEL` (find the real value if possible!), and `LABEL_DATA_DIR`.\n","# 2.  **Run:** Execute the entire script.\n","# 3.  **Check Output:**\n","#     * Look for any `!!! WARNING:` messages printed during processing. These indicate potential issues with the pixel counting for specific images, either the total sum doesn't match or the loop count differs from `np.unique`. Investigate these images if warnings appear.\n","#     * Review the summary statistics and the sample results to see if the costs seem plausible.\n","# 4.  **Save Results (Optional):** Uncomment the pandas CSV saving block at the end if you want a detailed file of costs and pixel counts per image.\n","\n","# %% [markdown]\n","# **Explanation and How to Use:**\n","#\n","# 1.  **Configuration:** Edit the values in the `CONFIGURATION SECTION` block. This is where you set:\n","#     * `COST_FACTORS_PER_SQ_M`: Change the dollar values per square meter for any class label. Making a value `0.0` means that class won't contribute to the cost.\n","#     * `GSD_METERS_PER_PIXEL`: **Crucially, update this** if you find the correct Ground Sample Distance for RescueNet, or refine your assumption.\n","#     * `LABEL_DATA_DIR`: Make sure this points to the correct directory holding the `.png` ground truth label files you want to analyze (e.g., from the `test` split).\n","# 2.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script. It will:\n","#     * Print the configuration being used.\n","#     * Find all `.png` files in the specified directory.\n","#     * Call `calculate_damage_cost` for each image.\n","#     * The function loads the image, counts pixels for every class defined in `CLASS_LABELS`, calculates the cost for classes with a non-zero cost factor, and sums them up.\n","#     * Print the total estimated cost for all images processed.\n","#     * Print detailed cost and pixel counts for the first few images as a sample.\n","# 3.  **Output (Optional):** The script includes commented-out code using `pandas` to save the detailed results (filename, total cost, pixel counts per class) to a CSV file. You can uncomment this section if you want to save the output for further analysis in a spreadsheet or other tools. Make sure `pandas` is installed (`pip install pandas`).\n","# 4.  **Integration:** Later, you will adapt the part that gets the `label_image` inside the `calculate_damage_cost` function (or adapt the main loop) to use the output masks from your segmentation model instead of reading files from `LABEL_DATA_DIR`."]}]}
